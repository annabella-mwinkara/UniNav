# UniNav - Campus Navigation & Safety System

## üéØ Problem Statement

### The Challenge
University campuses can be complex, confusing, and potentially unsafe environments, especially for:
- **New students** who don't know their way around
- **Visitors** unfamiliar with campus layout
- **Students walking alone** at night or in emergency situations
- **Anyone needing immediate help** during emergencies

### Current Issues on Campus
1. **Navigation Problems:**
   - Students get lost trying to find classrooms, offices, or facilities
   - Campus maps are often outdated or hard to read
   - No real-time directions between campus locations
   - Difficulty finding shortest/safest routes

2. **Safety Concerns:**
   - No quick way to alert security during emergencies
   - Students feel unsafe walking alone on campus
   - Delayed response time in emergency situations
   - No way to share location during emergencies

3. **Communication Gaps:**
   - No centralized system for campus navigation
   - Emergency contacts are hard to reach quickly
   - Security isn't immediately aware of student locations during emergencies
